PDCursed compiled with emscripten

(uglily) hacked by Lu Wang <coolwanglu@gmail.com>

This repo is supposed to demonstrate the power of emscripten as well as PDCurses,
and to inspire people who would like to hack those.

Prepare the dependencies and run `build.sh`.

There is no further documentation or support right now.

Read `README` in different folders for license stuffs.
